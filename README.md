# Solidifier

Solidifier is a Google Chrome extension focused on creating Anki flashcards by using YouTube videos and their transcription so that we can create accurate listening lessons.

When I started to improve my English vocabulary, Anki was primordial to my evolution. After a while, I sought a tool that could work on my listening skills using transcription lessons, but I didn't succeed in finding one. So, I decided to make my own tool.

Through this extension, we can choose moments of any public YouTube video to turn into a smart flashcard. We just need to set the start time and the end time of the video, and it can automatically become a flashcard without any effort.
